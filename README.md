## About me

I am a full stack engineer who has gone all in on AI driven development and automation. I created <a href="https://o11n.life">o11n</a>, an AI augmented IDE that helps developers ship faster with custom prompting interfaces on top of any LLM. I also run <a href="https://www.senna-automation.com">Senna Automation</a>, where I build custom AI automation and software for local businesses.

Previously, I spent almost seven years at Ridecell working on fleet management and shared mobility products for large enterprises, and I have over eight years of experience building tools and dashboards for public universities.
